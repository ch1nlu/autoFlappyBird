# autoFlappyBird

This is a simple Flappy Bird game implemented with **Pygame**. On top of that, the *enhanced topology neuroevolutionary* algorithm was applied to spawn a "super bird" who can nail the game!



To run the program, first need to `pip install` `pygame` and `neat`, then:

````shell
python flappy_bird.py
````
